Analysis of the Aave V2 Wallet Credit Scoring Model

This document provides an analysis of the rule-based credit scoring model developed for Aave V2 wallets. It covers the model's strengths, its inherent limitations given the problem constraints, and potential avenues for future improvement and validation.

Model Strengths

1) High Interpretability and Transparency:

* Clear Logic: The primary strength of this rule-based model is its transparency. Every point added or deducted from a wallet's score can be directly attributed to a specific transaction behavior (e.g., a deposit, a repayment, a liquidation). This makes the model's decisions easy to understand and explain, which is crucial for a "credit score" where trust and clarity are paramount.

* Debugging and Auditing: It's straightforward to audit the model's behavior for any given wallet, as there are no "black box" components. This simplifies debugging and allows for manual verification of scores.

2) No Labeled Data Dependency:

* The model does not require a pre-labeled dataset of "good" or "bad" wallets. This is a significant advantage in scenarios where such labels are scarce or non-existent, allowing for immediate deployment based on domain knowledge.

3) Simplicity and Ease of Implementation:

* The model is implemented as a single, one-step Python script. This makes it easy to set up, run, and integrate into other systems. The use of standard Python libraries (like json and collections) minimizes dependencies.

4) Robustness to Outliers (via capping):
* The scoring logic includes capping mechanisms (e.g., min(data['total_deposited_usd'] / 1000, 200)). This prevents extremely large, infrequent transactions from disproportionately skewing a wallet's score, making the model more stable.

 5) Use of Decimal for Financial Precision:

 * The use of Python's Decimal type for all financial calculations (amounts and USD values) is a critical strength. It eliminates floating-point inaccuracies that can occur with float types, ensuring precise and reliable financial computations, which is a best practice in financial applications.
